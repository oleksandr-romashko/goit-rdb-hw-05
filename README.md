## Nested SQL queries, functions, procedures, variables, and loops in SQL.

### Assignment Description

1. Write an SQL query that will display the `order_details` table and the `customer_id` field from the `orders` table corresponding to each record in the `order_details` table.
This should be done using a nested query in the `SELECT` statement.

2. Write an SQL query that will display the `order_details` table. Filter the results so that the corresponding record from the `orders` table meets the condition `shipper_id = 3`.
This should be done using a nested query in the `WHERE` operator.

3. Write an SQL query, nested in the `FROM` operator, that will select rows with the condition `quantity > 10` from the `order_details` table. For the obtained data, find the average value of the `quantity` field â€” grouping should be done by `order_id`.

4. Solve task 3 above using the `WITH` operator to create a temporary table `temp`. If your version of MySQL is earlier than 8.0, create this query similarly to how it is done in the lecture notes.

5. Create a function with two parameters that will divide the first parameter by the second. Both parameters and the return value should be of type `FLOAT`.
Use the `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` construct. Apply the function to the `quantity` attribute of the `order_details` table. The second parameter can be any number of your choice.
